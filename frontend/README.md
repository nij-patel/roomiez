**Available at: [roomiez.app](https://roomiez.app)**

Roomiez is a web application designed to simplify the roommate experience through intuitive digital tools for house management. Developed for TartanHacks 2025, where it won the Best Non-AI Prize. Made some changes to clean up the backend, frontend, and now available for use at the link above! (for free!)

## About

Made initially by 4 college roommates and best friends that kinda sucked at being roommates. Added a bunch of features that we thought would be super useful for us. We all graduated college so we aren't roommates anymore, but hopefully someone else can find some use for this!

## Features
