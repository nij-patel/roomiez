# Roomiez

**Available at: [roomiez.app](https://roomiez.app)**

Roomiez is a web application designed to simplify the roommate experience through various features that my roommates and I wished we had in college. Originally developed during TartanHacks 2025, where it won the Best Non-AI Prize. Made some changes to clean up the code + polish the features (it was pretty messy) and is now available for use at the link above! (for free!)
